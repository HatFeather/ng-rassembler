# Rassembler

This module provides a way to recursively assemble lists of
components based on a json schema.

The API for this package is still in progress.

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

## Limitations

This package does not currently support recursive rassemblies,
but will be added in the future.

## Notes

- components used by the rassembler must be entry components

## Build

Run `ng build ng-rassembler` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build ng-rassembler`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/ng-rassembler` and run `npm publish`.
